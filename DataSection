For this project we will be using:
  - The Canada Postal Table from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
  - The Canada city population Dataset from: https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities
  
*The Postal table will be used along with foursquare API to fetch desirable locations for our user.
*The Canada City(Borough) population dataset will give us a parameter to compare different cities, if the user wants to set up his/her business in another City/Borough.
